# SuperGlue - SuperGUIs
## Kotlin library for creating and handling spigot GUIs
<br>
Set it up before use (often in the onEnable) using 
`GUIManager.setup(JavaPlugin)`


to get started, make a class for your new gui by extending the 
GUI class, then implement the generateInventory() method.
The generateInventory method is most often followed by the `createInventory(...)` 
method which allows you to easily create and customise your menu.
